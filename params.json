However, the system still allows for explicit interference--if desired--and the users remain always in the loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical Information\r\n\r\n* Java 8+\r\n* Eclipse Mars+\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project Overview\r\n\r\n* TODO\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact and Main Contributors\r\n\r\n* Kaibin Bao (bao@kit.edu)\r\n* Sebastian Kochanneck (kochanneck@kit.edu)\r\n* Sebastian Kramer\r\n* Ingo Mauser (mauser@kit.edu) - Main contact\r\n* Jan M체ller (jan.mueller@kit.edu)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Literature\r\n\r\nFor further information, please consult the following publications:\r\n\r\nFlorian Allerding, Hartmut Schmeck: <br />\r\n\"Organic Smart Home - Architecture for Energy Management in Intelligent Buildings\", <br />\r\nProceedings of the 2011 workshop on Organic computing, 2011.  <br />\r\nhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1998654\r\n\r\nFlorian Allerding: <br />\r\n\"Organic Smart Home - Energiemanagement f체r Intelligente Geb채ude\", <br />\r\nKIT Scientific Publishing, 2013. <br />\r\nhttp://www.ksp.kit.edu/9783731501817\r\n\r\nIngo Mauser, Jan M체ller, Florian Allerding, Hartmut Schmeck: <br />\r\n\"Adaptive Building Energy Management with Multiple Commodities and Flexible Evolutionary Optimization\", <br />\r\nRenewable Energy, 87, Part 2, p.911-921, 2016. <br />\r\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148115302834\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe Organic Smart Home is licensed under the GPL. \r\n\r\nIf you have licensed this product under the GPL, please see the COPYING file for more information and the GPL version. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
