However, the system still allows for explicit interference--if desired--and the users remain always in the loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Technical Information\r\n\r\n* Java 8+\r\n* Eclipse Mars+\r\n\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n* <b>source</b> : source code of the Organic Smart Home\r\n* <b>source/osh_sim_builder</b> : OSH tools for the generation of XML configuration files (simulation mode) \r\n  * <code>constructSimulationPackage</code> : OSH configuration file generator\r\n* <b>source/osh_sim_loader</b> : OSH in simulation mode\r\n  * <code>runSimulationPackage</code> : OSH simulation launcher (simulation mode)\r\n* <b>source/osh_core</b> : core components of the OSH (e.g. generic components of the Observer/Controller architecture, Communication Registries, Energy Simulation Core)\r\n* <b>source/osh_ems_ea</b> : components of the optimization layer (partly based on [jMetal 4.x](https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal))\r\n* <b>source/osh_busdriver*</b> : bus drivers (Miele XGW2000 gateway, BacNet, EnOcean, WAGO 750-820*)\r\n* <b>source/osh_comdriver*</b> : communication drivers (user interaction, logging, REST service, external signals, weather prediction)\r\n* <b>source/osh_driver*</b> : device drivers (home appliances, baseload, battery storage, microCHP, HVAC, PV system, smart meter)\r\n* <b>source/xbin_lib</b> : required libraries (not provided, please see README for list of libraries)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact and Main Contributors\r\n\r\n* Kaibin Bao (bao@kit.edu)\r\n* Sebastian Kochanneck (kochanneck@kit.edu)\r\n* Sebastian Kramer\r\n* Ingo Mauser (mauser@kit.edu) - <b>main contact</b>\r\n* Jan M체ller (jan.mueller@kit.edu)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Literature\r\n\r\nFor further information, please consult the following publications:\r\n\r\nFlorian Allerding, Hartmut Schmeck: <br />\r\n\"Organic Smart Home - Architecture for Energy Management in Intelligent Buildings\", <br />\r\nProceedings of the 2011 workshop on Organic computing, 2011.  <br />\r\nhttp://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1998654\r\n\r\nFlorian Allerding: <br />\r\n\"Organic Smart Home - Energiemanagement f체r Intelligente Geb채ude\", <br />\r\nKIT Scientific Publishing, 2013. <br />\r\nhttp://www.ksp.kit.edu/9783731501817\r\n\r\nIngo Mauser, Jan M체ller, Florian Allerding, Hartmut Schmeck: <br />\r\n\"Adaptive Building Energy Management with Multiple Commodities and Flexible Evolutionary Optimization\", <br />\r\nRenewable Energy, 87, Part 2, p.911-921, 2016. <br />\r\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148115302834\r\n\r\n\r\n## Citing\r\n\r\nIf you use the Organic Smart Home in your research, please consider citing:\r\n<pre><code>\r\n@Article{mauser2016adaptive,\r\n  Title                    = {{Adaptive Building Energy Management with Multiple Commodities and Flexible Evolutionary Optimization}},\r\n  Author                   = {Ingo Mauser and Jan M{\\\"u}ller and Florian Allerding and Hartmut Schmeck},\r\n  Journal                  = {Renewable Energy},\r\n  Year                     = {2016},\r\n  Pages                    = {911 - 921},\r\n  Volume                   = {87, Part 2},\r\n  Doi                      = {10.1016/j.renene.2015.09.003},\r\n  ISSN                     = {0960-1481},\r\n  nolanguage = {English}\r\n}\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe Organic Smart Home is licensed under the GPL. \r\n\r\nIf you have licensed this product under the GPL, please see the LICENSE file for more information and the GPL version. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
